# Uncomment this variable definition to enable tmux support in
# your login shell. This will cause tmux to be loaded as part of
# login and replace the login shell completely, starting up a 
# subshell in a new window, or reusing an existing one if it
# has already been created. Perfect for remote SSH servers with
# multiple connections into it.
#
# Only set this if not already set. This may be set by the no_tmux
# function that opens a window explicitly without tmux.

#if [[ -z $USE_TMUX ]]; then USE_TMUX=true; fi

# If you have USE_TMUX enabled above, then specify an XTERM here
# and when you try to connect to a remote host via SSH, then a new
# terminal window will be opened using this terminal. You can
# also specify XTERM_OPTIONS to pass extra options into your
# terminal of choice.

#XTERM="gnome-terminal"
#XTERM_OPTIONS="--window"

# Setting BROWSER will enable many applications to use your web
# browser, but will also cause zshrc to load up some aliases so
# that you can easily open web addresses from your console.
#
# ie. $ google.com # Opens Google in your browser.

#BROWSER=chromium-browser
#BROWSER=firefox

# Setup aliases for our project folders
